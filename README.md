# Babylon Alphanet

As of September 28th, 2022, the Radix Alphanet is now live. It gives you the first occasion to run Scrypto code on a live network - rather than simply running on a simulated ledger. At this stage, nodes hosted by RDX Works will be doing consensus to process transactions submitted by users. Here are the differences and additional capabilities to what you are now able to do that you couldnâ€™t do on the Public Test Environment (PTE) release:

* You will have the chance to try out the first version of the Gateway API. 
* A new version of the wallet extension.
* The alphanet wallet extension is still primitive and will feel the same way as using the PTE wallet extension.
* A new version of the JavaScript SDK to communicate with the wallet and API.

Now that the Radix Alphanet is live, the PTE has been shut down. As a result, to get up and running you will have to download and install the new wallet extension. 

# Browser Extension
Alphanet Browser Extension is a proof-of-concept Chrome extension thats signs transactions using a local key pair. It is important to note that this Alphanet wallet has nothing to do with the DeFi wallet we are currently working on and that is going to be released for Babylon. This extension is temporary and that is why it does not look so polished. If you were used to the previous browser wallet version, you might now notice some nice new features that we are going to let you explore (like being able to remove all past transactions in a single click)!

Instructions on how to install the browser extension can be found [here](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/alphanet/wallet-extension.html)
